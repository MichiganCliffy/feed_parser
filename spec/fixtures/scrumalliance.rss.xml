        <title>Testing in Scrum with a Waterfall Interaction</title>

        <description>Sometimes, when testing user stories in Scrum, there's a final Waterfall  interaction to deal with. The scenario I present here is based on this  situation: a Scrum process with an interaction of sequential phases at  the end of the process to (re)test the whole developed functionality.  These sequential phases are mandatory for our organization, which  follows a Waterfall process for the releases of the product. So, for the  moment at least, we have to deal with this  and my experience is that  we aren't alone.</description>
